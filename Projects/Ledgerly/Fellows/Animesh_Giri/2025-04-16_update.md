Summary of Work Completed in Past Two Weeks:<br />
- Implemented core MCP logic for income statement and ratio blocks.<br />
- Connected Alpha Vantage and FMP APIs and parsed historical stock and ratio data.<br />
- Built single-stock analysis UI with Streamlit and GPT summary output.<br />
- Validated data parsing using live responses and handled malformed API structures.<br />

Challenges Encountered and How They Were Addressed:<br />
- Time-series stock data had inconsistent formatting — resolved using pandas time index.<br />
- GPT responses failed when context was empty — added validation and fallback logic.<br />

Goals for Next Two Weeks:<br />
- Add multi-stock comparison view with charts and comparative summaries.<br />
- Improve UI with themes, plot formatting, and navigation layout.<br />
