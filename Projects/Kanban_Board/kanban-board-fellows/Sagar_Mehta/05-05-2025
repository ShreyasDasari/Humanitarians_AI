Summary of Work Completed in Past Two Weeks:

Continued designing mobile screens in Figma for the PM role in the Kanban project

Showcased PM role mobile designs during the demo session
Participated in the team-wide presentation and observed progress made by other members

Challenges Encountered and How They Were Addressed:

Tight timeline for preparing the prototype ahead of the all-hands demo; prioritized core flows and UI polish to meet the deadline
Minor alignment issues across screen components were discovered during prototyping and resolved by updating shared styles

Goals for Next Two Weeks:

Continue refining the mobile screen designs for the Kanban project
Begin incorporating feedback from the demo session into the next design iteration

Explore adding micro-interactions to improve the prototype experience

Any Resources or Assistance Needed:
May need feedback from the PM or design lead on prioritization of mobile features for the next sprint

Hours Contributed During This Period:

I spent approximately 50 hours over the last two weeks working on the Kanban mobile design project
