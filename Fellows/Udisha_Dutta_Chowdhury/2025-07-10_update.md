### Biweekly Progress Report

Project Repo: https://github.com/Humanitariansai/Cyber-Physical-Systems

Reporting Period: June 30 - July 11, 2025

Student: Udisha Dutta Chowdhury

Supervisor: Prof. Rolando Herrero

### Summary of Work Completed

1. Project Architecture & Foundation (Week 1)

Established comprehensive project structure with modular components aligned with project requirements

Created Git repository workflow with feature branching strategy for organized development

Designed system architecture covering the complete cyber-physical pipeline:

Data collection from microcontrollers

ML forecasting models

Edge inference capabilities

Cloud-based dashboards

Security protocols

CI/CD workflows


2. Sensor Data Simulation System (Week 2)

Implemented comprehensive sensor simulation framework 

Developed core sensor classes:

TemperatureSensor - Realistic seasonal/daily temperature variations

HumiditySensor - Daily humidity patterns with environmental factors

PressureSensor - Weather-based atmospheric pressure simulation

SensorNetwork - Multi-sensor coordination and management

DataCollectionManager - High-level orchestration system


3. Worked on the initial architectural design

### Challenges Encountered and Solutions

Realistic Sensor Pattern Modeling

Issue: Creating mathematically accurate sensor patterns that mirror real-world behavior

Solution: Implemented trigonometric functions for seasonal/daily cycles, added configurable noise models, and included weather pattern simulation for pressure sensors

Scalable Architecture Design

Issue: Balancing modular design with system integration requirements

Solution: Adopted object-oriented design with clear interfaces, implemented configuration management, and created extensible base classes


### Goals for Next Two Weeks (July 14-26, 2025)

Continue with Sensor data simulation

Realistic pattern simulation: Seasonal cycles, daily variations, weather effects, configurable noise

Time series generation: Flexible duration and interval configuration for ML training data

Implement time-series forecasting models using Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and skforecast

Develop predictive algorithms for critical system variables (temperature trends, pressure changes)

Create model training pipeline with automated hyperparameter tuning

Establish model evaluation metrics and validation frameworks
