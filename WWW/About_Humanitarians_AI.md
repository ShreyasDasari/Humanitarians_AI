# About Humanitarians AI

## Our Mission

Humanitarians AI is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to harnessing the power of artificial intelligence for social good. We advance ethical AI through mentorship and community-building, promoting transparency and responsible research while educating and supporting the next generation of AI researchers and users.

We believe in creating AI solutions that benefit everyone, especially underserved communities. We actively work to bridge digital divides and ensure that AI technologies are accessible, inclusive, and representative of diverse perspectives and needs.

## Our Vision

We envision a world where AI is harnessed for the greater good, empowering communities, advancing knowledge, and solving critical challenges in education, healthcare, and social welfare. By fostering collaboration between technologists, domain experts, and community members, we're building a future where AI serves humanity's highest aspirations.

## Our Approach

We implement our mission through four key programs:

### Fellows Program
We mentor and support emerging AI researchers, practitioners, and community leaders, providing them with the guidance, resources, and network to develop responsible AI solutions that address pressing social challenges. The Fellows Program plays a central role in fostering the next generation of ethical AI innovators. Fellows are primarily recent graduates who continue to learn and develop their portfolios post-graduation until they secure a great career job.

### AI for Good
Leveraging artificial intelligence to address global challenges through cutting-edge research and innovative software solutions. This comprehensive program combines rigorous academic exploration with practical applications to create positive social impact. Through research, we promote transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI systems. Through software development, we deploy practical solutions that tackle real-world problems.

### Lyrical Literacy
Enhancing cognitive development through music and AI. We harness AI for promoting language development through singing, developing AI-powered tools, songbooks, and interactive platforms that encourage daily engagement with music. By integrating neuroscience research with AI, we maximize impact on language acquisition, memory enhancement, and overall brain health for diverse populations.

### Botspeak
A series of YouTube videos, hybrid workshops, and learning tools designed to teach people how to effectively engage with Large Language Models by speaking "their language." These resources bridge the gap between technical and non-technical users, democratizing access to AI capabilities through practical communication skills.
