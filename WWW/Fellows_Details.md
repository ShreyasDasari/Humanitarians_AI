### Documentation Requirements

**Bi-Weekly Updates (MANDATORY)**

All fellows MUST provide updates at minimum every two weeks. This is non-negotiable and essential for maintaining active status in the program.

Your bi-weekly updates should:

1. Be committed directly to your personal folder in the Fellows directory
2. Use the following naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_update.md`
3. Include:
   - Summary of work completed in the past two weeks
   - Challenges encountered and how they were addressed
   - Goals for the next two weeks
   - Any resources or assistance needed
   - Hours contributed during this period

### Tracking and Evaluation

The GitHub-based tracking system provides an objective basis for evaluating your contributions. The following metrics will be considered when assessing your work:

- Frequency and quality of commits
- Consistency of bi-weekly updates
- Contributions to project milestones
- Collaboration with other team members
- Quality and impact of work produced

### Recommendation Letters and Verifications

Recommendation letters will only be issued to fellows who:
1. Have been active contributors for a minimum duration (typically 2-3 months)
2. Have maintained regular bi-weekly updates throughout their involvement
3. Have made substantial, verifiable contributions to their project
4. Have properly documented their work following the guidelines above

The same documentation requirements apply to any visa or employment verification requests. Active participation must be continuously documented through GitHub. If you stop making bi-weekly updates, we will assume you left the program on the date of your last update.

### Entrepreneurship Program

If you plan to use code or other intellectual property developed during your volunteer work with Humanitarians AI for commercial purposes or to start a business, you **MUST**:

1. Apply to be part of the official Humanitarians AI Entrepreneurship Program

3. Formalize this relationship through proper legal agreements

For those participating in the Entrepreneurship Program:
- Regular team meetings will be held to discuss entrepreneurial opportunities
