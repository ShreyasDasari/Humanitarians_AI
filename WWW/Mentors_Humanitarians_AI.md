# Mentor Guidelines for OPT Fellows at Humanitarians AI

## Introduction

This document outlines the responsibilities of mentors working with Humanitarians AI fellows who are on Optional Practical Training (OPT). As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, Humanitarians AI provides valuable practical training opportunities for international students while advancing our mission of using AI for social good.

Mentors at Humanitarians AI serve primarily as educators and guides, focusing on the fellow's technical and professional development. Humanitarians AI handles the administrative aspects of the OPT process, including formal documentation and verification.

## Understanding OPT Requirements

OPT fellows face specific regulatory requirements that mentors must understand:

1. **Employment Relationship**: OPT fellows must maintain employment directly related to their field of study
2. **Minimum Hours**: Fellows must work at least 20 hours per week to maintain legal F-1 OPT status
3. **Unemployment Limitations**: Fellows cannot accrue more than 90 days of unemployment during their OPT period
4. **Documentation**: Proper documentation of the employment relationship is essential

## Mentor Responsibilities

### 1. Project Alignment & Educational Focus

- **Ensure Field Relevance**: Design projects that clearly relate to the fellow's academic field of study
- **Monitor Documentation**: 
  - Regularly review the fellow's documentation on GitHub as described at: https://github.com/nikbearbrown/Humanitarians_AI/tree/main/Fellows
  - Promptly inform Humanitarians AI if a fellow is not properly documenting their work
  - Ensure fellows understand the importance of documentation for OPT compliance
- **Documentation Support**: 
  - Assist fellows with technical documentation of their work
  - Help fellows articulate how their work relates to their academic field
  - Guide fellows in documenting educational/training components of their experience

**Note**: Humanitarians AI will handle formal employment documentation and offer letters, especially for mentors who do not have an e-verify US business or organization.

### 2. Structured Supervision

- **Regular Check-ins**: Conduct weekly or bi-weekly meetings to:
  - Review progress on assigned projects
  - Provide technical guidance and feedback
  - Address challenges and adjust project scope as needed
  - Document attendance and participation
- **Clear Expectations**: Set clear deliverables and deadlines
- **Work Verification**: Track and verify that fellows maintain the minimum 20 hours per week requirement

### 3. Educational Development

- **Training Plan**: Develop a structured training plan outlining:
  - Skills to be developed
  - Learning objectives
  - Progression of responsibilities
  - Evaluation criteria
- **Skill Development**: Focus on building technical and professional skills relevant to the fellow's field
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Share expertise and guide research/implementation methodology
- **Industry Exposure**: Connect fellows with relevant professionals and resources

### 4. Documentation Oversight and Recommendation Letters

- **Monitor Activity Documentation**: Ensure fellows maintain detailed logs of:
  - Hours worked (minimum 20 per week)
  - Tasks completed
  - Skills developed
  - Technologies utilized
- **GitHub Documentation**: 
  - Regularly verify fellows maintain proper GitHub documentation according to guidelines at: https://github.com/nikbearbrown/Humanitarians_AI/tree/main/Fellows
  - Ensure bi-weekly updates are being submitted
  - Review code contributions and project documentation
  - Alert Humanitarians AI if documentation requirements are not being met
- **Recommendation Letters**: As the primary technical mentor, you will be the one fellows approach for recommendation letters. These should include:
  - Detailed description of the fellow's technical contributions
  - Assessment of skills developed and demonstrated
  - Evaluation of work quality and impact
  - Confirmation of project relevance to academic field
  - Professional growth observations

  - Ensure fellows understand the 20-hour minimum requirement
  - Help fellows accurately track and document their hours
  - Alert Humanitarians AI if a fellow appears to be falling below required hours

### Supporting Documentation for Immigration Purposes

While Humanitarians AI handles formal verification letters, mentors should:
- Provide technical details about projects and skills for inclusion in documentation
- Offer input for verification letters when requested
- Be available to confirm the educational nature and technical relevance of the fellow's work
- Alert Humanitarians AI immediately if documentation issues arise that could affect a fellow's OPT status

## Best Practices for OPT Mentorship

1. **Understand Each Fellow's Background**:

   - Identify specific skills to develop

3. **Balance Guidance and Autonomy**:
   - Provide clear direction while encouraging independent problem-solving
   - Gradually increase project ownership
   - Foster innovation while ensuring practical training objectives are met

4. **Facilitate Professional Development**:
   - Encourage conference participation or paper submissions
   - Create opportunities for presentation and communication skills
   - Provide feedback on professional growth

5. **Maintain Clear Communication**:
   - Set explicit expectations about deliverables and timelines
   - Provide regular, constructive feedback
   - Document all significant communications

## Legal Considerations for Unpaid Positions

For unpaid positions, mentors must ensure the following to comply with Department of Labor regulations:

1. **Educational Focus**: The experience must be primarily for the benefit of the fellow
2. **Professional Environment**: Training must be similar to that given in an educational environment
3. **Business Operations**: Regular operations should not be dependent on the fellow's work
4. **Displacement**: Fellows should not displace regular employees
5. **Educational Benefit**: The mentor provides significant educational benefits through close supervision
6. **Expectations**: No guarantee of employment following the training period
