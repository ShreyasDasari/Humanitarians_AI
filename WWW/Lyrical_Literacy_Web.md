## About the Project
Lyrical Literacy is a pioneering initiative from Humanitarians AI that harnesses artificial intelligence to enhance cognitive and language development through music. This research-based program explores the powerful intersection of neuroscience, music, and education to create personalized learning experiences for diverse populations.
